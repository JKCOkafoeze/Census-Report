This report presents a data analysis of a mock census from an imaginary mid-sized town in the United Kingdom, with a population of 8,577 in 1881. The analysis provides insights into the town's demographics, economic structure, and population distribution. Key findings show that 54.94% of the population is employed, with a student population constituting 25.77%. The report highlights the dominant age groups (30-49 years), the significant proportion of commuters, and the town's declining growth rate over the last decade.

The data cleaning process involved verifying columns for errors, handling empty strings, converting data types, and adding additional columns for deeper analysis, such as "Occupancy" and "Annual salary." Data analysis revealed an average household occupancy of 3, with no need for high-density housing. Despite a stable economy, the town's growth rate remains below 1%, indicating a need for interventions to attract new residents.

Based on the findings, the report recommends utilizing an unused plot of land for a train station to support the commuting population, which comprises half of the town. Additionally, the council should introduce child support programs to encourage population growth, modeled after systems in countries like Sweden and Canada. Such initiatives would improve living conditions, attract new inhabitants, and address long-term sustainability by increasing the town's tax base and supporting the aging population.
